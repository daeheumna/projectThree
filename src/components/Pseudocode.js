// Pseudocode
// Create a state item to hold data coming from the API and user input
    // Recipes from APIS
    // ingredients from user

// call useState to initialize state to keep track of ingredients that the user has submitted

// Once the component has been mounted, run a "side effect" (fetch recieps from API)
// Once the data comes back successfuly, save it within state

// Use a handleChange function to handle the submit event to update state with the ingredients that the user inputs

// Render the application
    // Header
    // form for user to input ingredients
    // User preferences *stretch goal*
    // imported results component
    // footer

// Render the Results
    // Create a list that will display data coming from API
    // Map through the array of recipe objects & render them on page
